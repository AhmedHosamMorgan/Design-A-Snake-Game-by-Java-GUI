This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game in Java using Swing. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, eating apples to grow longer. The player controls the direction of the snake using arrow keys. The game ends when the snake collides with itself or the boundaries of the screen.

How to Play

   - Use the arrow keys to control the direction of the snake.
   - The snake will continuously move in the direction it is facing.
   - Guide the snake to eat the red apples that appear on the screen.
   - Each apple eaten increases the length of the snake and the player's score.
   - Avoid letting the snake collide with itself or the screen boundaries.

Features

    - Random generation of apples on the screen.
    - Score tracking based on the number of apples eaten.
    - Collision detection to end the game when the snake collides with itself or the screen boundaries.

Controls

    - Left Arrow: Move the snake left.
    - Right Arrow: Move the snake right.
    - Up Arrow: Move the snake up.
